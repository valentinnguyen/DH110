## (Tentative Title) Closing the Generation Gap Between Elders and the Youth
#### Valentin Nguyen | H110 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation | Spring 2021

## Project description:
Generation gaps are an inevitable phenomenon that happens naturally as cultures, trends, music genres, and language develop across eras. The youth might often hear elders being their phrases with, "Kids these days..." or, "When I was young..." The contrast between generations largely has to do with the advancement of technology. Although boomers (refered to those born between 1946 to 1964, whom are now between 58 to 65 years old as of 2021) use the Internet on a regular basis, Millenials (20 to 36 year olds) and younger generation are much more involved and technologically well-versed. To bridge the generation gap between the youth and elders, I wanted to explore the idea of creating a service and digital space that will allow both age groups to communicate and form relationships through a video chat feature, not only to create companionship and mitigate stigmas that each group may have on the other, but also to encourage an efficient and accessible way for people to meet others with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities. I would also like to explore ways that can make a site/app more accessible and easy to use for elders.

## [Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)

The table below indicates a rating scale from 1 to 3 to represent the severity of usability problems.

| Rating | Importance |
| :----: | ---------- |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem Only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project. |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority. |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be give high priority. |

## Heuristic Evaluation of Website #1: [Omegle](https://www.omegle.com/)

O<img width="1680" alt="Omegle Homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81778205/113912737-5578d880-9790-11eb-8510-a58beedb8e87.png">

##### Initial Evaluation

Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Omegle's aim is to connect people from all over, no matter where they are or who they are. Its homepage looks very outdated and has poor UI, but all the essential elements are there: social media buttons at the top righthand corner, a bar where the user can type in what their interests are, and a 'text' and 'video' option that the user can choose from. Additionally, there is a description of Omegle and what it is as well as an open terms of agreement at the bottom. 

##### Heuristic Evaluation

| Heuristic & Description | Good Evaluation | Bad Evaluation | Possible Solution |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
|1. **Visibility of System Status:** The system gives the user immediate feedback about the way they interact with the site. | When the user clicks inside the type box, a vertical line blinks, indicating that the user clicked in the box. | The "Text" and "Video" buttons and hyperlinks on the homepage do not change color or texture when the cursor hovers over them.  | Change the color of the clickable and hyperlinked features so that the user knows their mouse is hovering over them. |
|2. **Match Between System + World:** Design and symbols are elements that the user easily and intuitively recognizes. | Users who are familiar with technology and are well-versed in websites no matter how developed they are will intuitively know what the hyperlinks will lead them to. | A big blue box that says, "Video is monitored. Keep it clean" has two hyperlinks below it: "Adult" and "Unmoderated Section." These words might be vague for those who are not familiar with moderated features on an app and. | Instead of saying "Adult" and "Unmoderated Section," just put one button that says "Unmoderated Section (Adults Only)." |
|3. **User Control & Freedom:** Options that user has when navigating the app. | Users have the option of choosing whether they would like to start chatting through "Text" or "Video." Also, users can type in their interests that indicate things that they want to talk about it in their conversation.| Once the user is in the chat feature, there is no button that brings the user back to the homepage. | Attach a link to the homepage on the main logo in the top lefthand corner. |
|4. **Consistency & Standards:** Design and format of the pages are consistent and follow platform and industry and conventions. | Omegle's logo and name is in a bright orange color in the top lefthand corner, allowing users to recognize that this is the homepage. | Also, Usually when the user is prepared to enter the interactive portion of a website or app, there is an "Enter" button. However, users who are not familiar with that experience will not know immediately that they have to click on the "Text" or "Video" button to use Omegle's services. | Insert a button that says "Enter" or "Start chatting!" for users to click on when they are ready to enter the site's service. |
|5. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Limit the user's memory by making options and elements easily visible. | None. | When the user types in their interests in the "Add your interests (optional)" box, there is no way the user can tell if what their typing is a valid "interest" or not. | Add a dropdown menu with suggestions for their interests, or display buttons highlighting popular and select interests that users have made in the past. |
|6. **Error Prevention:** Error messages that prevent problems from occuring for the user. | None. There is no indicator on the site that shows whether the user has made or error or provided wrong information. | There are no indications that tell the users that they are navigating the website properly. | The interest bar could offer a dropdown menu with suggestions while the system detects words being typed, which could be useful to prevent misspellings. |
|7. **Flexbility and Efficiency of Use:** Shortcuts that speed up the interaction between the user and the site/app. | Users can simply click one button ("Text" or "Video) to enter the Omegle service. | Users may not intuitively or quickly know which buttons to click right away, which is inefficient if they are not well-versed in technology. | Format the homepage so that there are sections (one for a description of the app and service, another for a space that will clearly lead users directly to Omegle's chatting service). |
|8. **Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design:** How well the interface includes necessary information and does not add anything irrelevant. | The main Omegle logo has a distinct orange color and unique typeface. | The entire website is poorly laid out and appears very visually outdated compared to more modern websites. | Change the typeface to something more modern, keep the color scheme minial, add more shapes and interactive buttons, and etc. |
|9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** Error messages that indicate a problem and suggest a solution. | None. There are no indicators that appear when the user has made a problem, and there are no suggestions for solutions. | No search bar or search for help. Lack of indicators that tell the user they are interacting with the site. | Add an FAQ/Q&A section that users can go to when they have trouble navigating the app. |
|10. **Help & Documentation:** Provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. | None. There is no webpage that helps users understand how to navigate the interface. | There are no indications that users can go to when they need help. | Add a "Contact Us" button, a "FAQ/Q&A" section in the navigation bar, or a simple "Help" button somewhere on the homepage. |

##### Severity Rating
1. **Cosmetic Problem(s):** help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, flexbility and efficiency of use
2. **Minor Usability Problem(s):** User control and freedom, error prevention, recognition rather than recall
3. **Major Usability Problem(s):** aesthetic and minimalistic design, user control and freedom, match between system and real world, visibility of system status, help and documentation

##### Overall Evaluation
Overall, Omegle has a lot of major usability issues that can leave any user, whether they are well-versed in technology or are new to technology, confused and unattracted to the site. Omegle's service has a lot of potential and many people know about it, but the website development itself could be improved so that it is more modern.

## Heuristic Evaluation of Website #2: [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/)

<img width="1680" alt="AmeriCorps Homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81778205/113912767-5f024080-9790-11eb-8847-2d628b19ad79.png">

##### Initial Evaluation

AmeriCorps is a federal agency that brings elders together to directly serving nonprofit organizations. Its mission is to strengthen communities and foster civic engagement through service and volunteering. It is mostly a site where seniors ages 55 and older can deliver acts of services such as collaborating with schools, responding to environmental disasters, combating housing and food insecurity, and more. At first glance, the homepage is clear and states program's mission straight away. The navigation bar is clearly at the top for easy access, and the overall site design has a distinct color scheme accompanied with enticing photos.

##### Heuristic Evaluation

| Heuristic & Description | Good Evaluation | Bad Evaluation | Possible Solution |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
|1. **Visibility of System Status:** The system gives the user immediate feedback about the way they interact with the site. | When the cursor hovers over buttons, the buttons change color and indicates when the user is about to click on the buttons. Titles in the navigation bar are underlined when the cursor hovers over them. | None. There are multiple, consistent indicators that elements show when the user interacts with them. | Make the buttons throughout the pages in the website consistent in design whenever the user's cursor hovers over them. For example, have work all buttons change into the same color when hovered over. |
|2. **Match Between System + World:** Design and symbols are elements that the user easily and intuitively recognizes. | The icon in the top righthand corner of the magnifying glass leads the user to a search bar. | In the navigation bar, more links appear in a dropdown menu under the "Partner" tab with titles and acronyms that users may not know immediately. | Spell out the acronyms so that the users won't have to guess what they mean. |
|3. **User Control & Freedom:** Options that user has when navigating the app. | When a user wants to make a profile on the website, there are three options on the bottom righthand corner: cancel, previous, and next. Useres have the option to select either of these buttons if they want to stop the process, go to the previous page, or move to the next page. | None, there are a lot of opportunities for users to navigate the site. | None, there are a lot of opportunities for users to navigate the site. |
|4. **Consistency & Standards:** Design and format of the pages are consistent and follow platform and industry and conventions. | The navigation bar holds the necessary information that the user will most likely need, such as the "about" page and "contact" page. | The navigation bar might have too many options for the user to take in at first glance and could just provide the essential pages for users new to the site.| Keep the navigation bar limited to only the essentials and bring the extra menu options down in a dropdown menu under those essential tabs. |
|5. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Limit the user's memory by making options and elements easily visible. | Navigation bar,  search bar, and bottom menu bar are all in the same place in every webpage, making it easy for the user to recognize where they are. | The search bar does not include previous searches the user may have made. | Add a dropdown menu indicating that the system recognizes previous searches the user has made. |
|6. **Error Prevention:** Error messages that prevent problems from occuring for the user. | When the user fills out the form to make a profile, there is an asterisk next to the fields that they must fill out before moving on to the next page. | The asterisks are difficult to see at first glance because of how small they are; they don't pop up otherwise. | Change the color of the asterisk so that they are more noticeable. |
|7. **Flexbility and Efficiency of Use:** Shortcuts that speed up the interaction between the user and the site/app. | Throughout the pages on the website are buttons that users can click on if they want to learn more about a piece of information that was said (i.e. "See all news," "Explore more articles," "Find out more," etc.). | Pages can be long to scroll through, and no option appears to go to the navigation bar when the user is halfway through the whole page. | While the user scrolls down a page, add an option on the side or bottom of the page that allows the user to go "back to the top," or allow the navigation bar to stay on the screen while the user scrolls down the page. |
|8. **Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design:** How well the interface includes necessary information and does not add anything irrelevant. | The main homepage and the rest of the pages on the website are consistent in color and layout. Typeface choice is clear to read and are the approriate sizes (headers are larger fonts, paragraphs are smaller, etc.). Paragraphs are organized in blocks and sections in every page, making information easy to read and scroll through. | The page where users make a profile does not match the main website in format, colors, and overall layout. | Keep every page consistent and apply the same rules of design of aesthetic with the main homepage of the site. |
|9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** Error messages that indicate a problem and suggest a solution. | When a user does not fill out a part of the form that is required, the page will immediately mention which area of the form the user needs to fill out in red font. | On the search bar, there is no indication for advanced search filters. A user would not know if their formatting in hteir search is correct or not. | Add a dropdown menu while the user types in the search bar so that they know what they're typing is formatted correctly. |
|10. **Help & Documentation:** Provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. | In  the nevigation bar, there is a "contact" tab clearly there for users to click on. There is also an option to look at FAQs under the "about" tab. | None. There are clear directions and opportunities for the user to look for help. | It might be better to make the FAQ more obviously visual, but it isn't the biggest issue on the website overall. |

##### Severity Rating
1. **Cosmetic Problem(s):** Visibility of system status
2. **Minor Usability Problem(s):** Consistency and standards, aesthetic and minimalist design
3. **Major Usability Problem(s):** Flexbility and efficiency of use

##### Overall Evaluation
Overall, the AmeriCorps website is an aesthetic and ethically user-friendly website with easy navigation. There are only minor elements (such as the profile registration page) that needs to be more consistent with the rest of the website in general, but the majority of the site is accessible for anyone no matter what their level of technological ability is.
