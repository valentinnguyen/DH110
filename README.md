## (Tentative Title) Closing the Generation Gap Between Elders and the Youth
#### Valentin Nguyen | H110 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation | Spring 2021

## Project description:
Generation gaps are an inevitable phenomenon that happens naturally as cultures, trends, music genres, and language develop across eras. The youth might often hear elders being their phrases with, "Kids these days..." or, "When I was young..." The contrast between generations largely has to do with the advancement of technology. Although boomers (refered to those born between 1946 to 1964, whom are now between 58 to 65 years old as of 2021) use the Internet on a regular basis, Millenials (20 to 36 year olds) and younger generation are much more involved and technologically well-versed. To bridge the generation gap between the youth and elders, I wanted to explore the idea of creating a service and digital space that will allow both age groups to communicate and form relationships through a video chat feature, not only to create companionship and mitigate stigmas that each group may have on the other, but also to encourage an efficient and accessible way for people to meet others with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities.

## [Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)

The table below indicates a rating scale from 1 to 3 to represent the severity of usability problems.

| Rating | Importance |
| :----: | ---------- |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem Only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project. |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority. |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be give high priority. |

## Heuristic Evaluation of Website #1: [Omegle](https://www.omegle.com/)

##### Initial Evaluation

Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Omegle's aim is to connect people from all over, no matter where they are or who they are. Its homepage looks very outdated and has poor UI, but all the essential elements are there: social media buttons at the top righthand corner, a bar where the user can type in what their interests are, and a 'text' and 'video' option that the user can choose from. Additionally, there is a description of Omegle and what it is as well as an open terms of agreement at the bottom. 

##### Heuristic Evaluation

| Heuristic & Description | Good Evaluation | Bad Evaluation | How to Improve |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
|1. **Visibility of System Status:** | When the user clicks inside the type box, a vertical line blinks, indicating that the user clicked in the box. | The "Text" and "Video" buttons and hyperlinks on the homepage do not change color or texture when the cursor hovers over them.  | Change the color of the clickable and hyperlinked features so that the user knows their mouse is hovering over them. |
|2. **Match Between System + World:** | Users who are familiar with technology and are well-versed in websites no matter how developed they are will intuitively know what the hyperlinks will lead them to. | A big blue box that says, "Video is monitored. Keep it clean" has two hyperlinks below it: "Adult" and "Unmoderated Section." These words might be vague for those who are not familiar with moderated features on an app and. | Instead of saying "Adult" and "Unmoderated Section," just put one button that says "Unmoderated Section (Adults Only)." |
|3. **User Control & Freedom:** | Users have the option of choosing whether they would like to start chatting through "Text" or "Video." Also, users can type in their interests that indicate things that they want to talk about it in their conversation.| Once the user is in the chat feature, there is no button that brings the user back to the homepage. | Attach a link to the homepage on the main logo in the top lefthand corner. |
|4. **Consistency & Standards:** | Omegle's logo and name is in a bright orange color in the top lefthand corner, allowing users to recognize that this is the homepage. | Also, Usually when the user is prepared to enter the interactive portion of a website or app, there is an "Enter" button. However, users who are not familiar with that experience will not know immediately that they have to click on the "Text" or "Video" button to use Omegle's services. | Insert a button that says "Enter" or "Start chatting!" for users to click on when they are ready to enter the site's service. |
|5. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** | None. | When the user types in their interests in the "Add your interests (optional)" box, there is no way the user can tell if what their typing is a valid "interest" or not. | Add a dropdown menu with suggestions for their interests, or display buttons highlighting popular and select interests that users have made in the past. |
|6. **Error Prevention:** | None. | There are no indications that tell the users that they are navigating the website properly. | The interest bar could offer a dropdown menu with suggestions while the system detects words being typed, which could be useful to prevent misspellings. |
|7. **Flexbility and Efficiency of Use:** | Users can simply click one button ("Text" or "Video) to enter the Omegle service. | Users may not intuitively or quickly know which buttons to click right away, which is inefficient if they are not well-versed in technology. | Either format the homepage so that there are sections (one for a description of the app and service, another for a space where users can type in their information and a button that will clearly lead them directly to Omegle's chatting service), or add distinct tabs (about page, registration page, contact page, etc.) in the navigation bar that each present a different feature of the website. |
|8. **Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design:** | The main Omegle logo has a distinct orange color and unique typeface. | The entire website is poorly laid out and appears very visually outdated compared to more modern websites. | Change the typeface to something more modern, keep the color scheme minial, add more shapes and interactive buttons, and etc. |
|9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:** | None. | No search bar or search for help. Lack of indicators that tell the user they are interacting with the site. | Add an FAQ/Q&A section that users can go to when they have trouble navigating the app. |
|10. **Help & Documentation:** | None. | There are no indications that users can go to when they need help. | Add a "Contact Us" button, a "FAQ/Q&A" section in the navigation bar, or a simple "Help" button somewhere on the homepage. |
